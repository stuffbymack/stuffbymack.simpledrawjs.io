# SimpleDrawJS

SimpleDrawJS is a lightweight, web-based rendition of the SimpleDraw Java program, providing an easy-to-use drawing tool right in your browser.

## Features

- **512x512 Pixel Canvas**: Mirroring the Java version, it operates on a fixed-size canvas.
- **15-Pixel Brush**: Consistent with SimpleDraw, it provides a 15-pixel brush for precise drawings.
- **Windows Vista Paint Color Palette**: Classic color selection options are maintained in this version.
- **PNG Image Export**: Functionality to save your art as PNG images.
- **Canvas Clear Functionality**: A feature to start fresh with a clear canvas.

## Usage
